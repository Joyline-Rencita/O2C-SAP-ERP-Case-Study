# O2C Deviations Dashboard

## Overview
The Order-to-Cash (O2C) Deviations Dashboard provides insights into deviations within the O2C process, helping users analyze, understand, and act upon areas where process deviations impact performance. This document outlines the data requirements, dashboard components, and expected functionalities to support effective analysis and management of O2C deviations.

## Data Requirements


### Key Data Elements

To build this dashboard effectively, the following data elements are essential:

1. **Sales Order Line Item Data**
   - Attributes: Order number, line item number, item details, order status, etc.

2. **Deviation Data**
   - Attributes: Deviation type (e.g., "Remove Delivery Block," "Approve Credit Check," "Change Price"), occurrence date, reason, responsible party, etc.

3. **Process Time Data**
   - Attributes: Time taken for each activity in the O2C process, including time taken for handling deviations.

4. **Customer Data**
   - Attributes: Customer ID, customer type, customer location, etc.

5. **Plant Data**
   - Attributes: Plant ID, plant location, plant capacity, etc.

6. **Material Data**
   - Attributes: Material ID, material type, material value, etc.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Deviation Frequency and Impact
   - **Table**:  
     - Displays the top 10 most frequent deviations, showing occurrence count and estimated monetary impact.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Visualizes the frequency of deviations over time using a line or bar chart.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Shows the distribution of monetary impact using a histogram or box plot.

### 2. Deviation Analysis
   - **Drill-down Table**:  
     - Allows users to click on a specific deviation type to view detailed information about individual cases.
   - **Charts**:  
     - Visualizes the distribution of deviation reasons, responsible parties, and occurrence times.
   - **Maps** (if applicable):  
     - Displays the geographical distribution of deviations using a map component.

### 3. Process Time Impact
   - **Chart**:  
     - Compares the average process time for orders with deviations versus those without deviations.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Shows the distribution of additional time caused by deviations.

### 4. Customer Behavior Analysis
   - **Table**:  
     - Compares key metrics such as order frequency and average order value for customers with and without deviations.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Visualizes the distribution of customer types or locations associated with deviations.

### 5. Root Cause Analysis
   - **Table**:  
     - Lists potential root causes based on data analysis.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Shows correlation between deviations and specific customers, plants, or materials.

### 6. Recommendation and Prioritization
   - **Table**:  
     - Summarizes recommendations for addressing each deviation type.
   - **Chart**:  
     - Visualizes the potential impact of addressing each deviation, such as estimated cost savings or improved customer satisfaction.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Data Upload**:  
   - Ensure all required data (sales orders, deviations, process times, customer, plant, and material data) is imported into the dashboardâ€™s data repository.
   
2. **Navigation**:
   - Use filters on the dashboard to narrow down data by date, customer, plant, deviation type, or other key parameters.
   
3. **Exploring Components**:
   - Select a deviation type to access in-depth analysis in the **Deviation Analysis** section.
   - Review potential root causes and recommendations under **Root Cause Analysis**.
   
4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - View suggestions under **Recommendation and Prioritization** to address high-impact deviations and optimize the O2C process.

## Technical Specifications
- **Data Integration**: Automated data pipeline or scheduled data upload is recommended to keep the dashboard current.
- **Filtering and Drill-down Capabilities**: Dynamic filters allow users to refine data views.
- **Visualizations**: Line charts, bar charts, histograms, and maps to be implemented using visualization libraries.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the dashboard through drill-down options and customizable timeframes.
